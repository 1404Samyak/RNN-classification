This solves a text case using TFIDF vectorizer to vectorize the feature that contains sentences 
So in our dataset we can have categorical features basically single string  ,this can be handles as we handle categorical features in ML algorithms 
Now for sentences we can use TFIDF vectorizer to convert sentences to numerical data
